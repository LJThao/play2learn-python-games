# LJ's Play2Learn Python Games Project - Math Facts Practice & Anagram Hunt Games
In this project, I'm going to create Python versions of the two Play2Learn games that can be played from the console.

Feel free to play my games!


## How it works for both games

- Run "math_facts.py" in the console and you should be prompted to enter an operation and start playing!!

- Run "anagram_hunt.py" in the console and you should be prompted to enter a word length and start playing!
